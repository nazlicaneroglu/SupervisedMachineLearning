Udemy is one of the most popular platforms for online learning in recent years. Due to the COVID19, it has gained even more significance as it offers many free and beginner level courses on almost any subject, including music. It is likely that these courses have been successful in helping students learn and improve their skills in music, as many of them have received positive reviews from students. However, it is difficult to provide specific information on the success of Udemy’s musical instrument courses, as this information is not publicly available. The analysis of the determinants of the subscriber number can help similar companies or content creators to optimize the success of their courses. Therefore, we attempt to answer the research question:
To what extent random forest and regularized regression techniques predict the success of a Udemy course on musical instruments by considering courses’ price, number of reviews and lectures, level, rating and the content duration?
